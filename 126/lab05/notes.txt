1) TO calculate time complexity of the added functions, we must account for each operationg depending on if its the arrayList or linkedlist class.

arrayList functions:
min():    This is 0(N) due to having to iterate through the size of the array. The amount of operations depends on the size.
max():    This is 0(N) due to having to iterate through the size of the array. The amount of operations depends on the size.
count():  This is 0(N) due to having to iterate through the size of the array. The amount of operations depends on the size.
extend(): This is 0(N) due to having to iterate through the size of the array. The amount of operations depends on the size.


linkedlist functions:
min():    This is 0(N) due to having to iterate through the size of the list. The amount of operations depends on the size. Even if the first element is the lowest,
the list must still continue forward each element to ensure minimization.

max():    This is 0(N) due to having to iterate through the size of the list. The amount of operations depends on the size.

count():  This is 0(N) due to having to iterate through the size of the list. The amount of operations depends on the size.

extend(): This is 0(N) due to having to iterate through the size of the list. The amount of operations depends on the size. In a normal
list, this is normally constant, but since we are extending by a certain amount, this transforms in complexity.
